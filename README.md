## Project Overview
In reviewing the data in the Performance Lawn Equipment Database, Elizabeth Burke noticed that defects received from suppliers have decreased (worksheet Defects After Delivery). Upon investigation, she learned that in 2014, PLE experienced some quality problems due to an increasing number of defects in materials received from suppliers. The company instituted an initiative in August 2015 to work with suppliers to reduce these defects, to more closely coordinate deliveries, and to improve materials quality through reengineering supplier production policies. Ms. Burke noted that the program appeared to reverse an increasing trend in defects; she would like to predict what might have happened had the supplier initiative not been implemented and how the number of defects might further be reduced in the near future.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this business analytics project is to perform trendlines and regression analysis in excel to develop solution to the following key questions: 
-	What might have happened if PLE supplier did not take the initiative as of August 2015?
-	How can PLE defects reduce even more in the future?
